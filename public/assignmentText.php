Create a beginner's Laravel Project as Mr. X
Task 1:

Create a new migration file to add a new table named "categories" to the database. The table should have the following columns:

id (primary key, auto-increment) name (string) created_at (timestamp) updated_at (timestamp)

Task 2:

Create a new model named "Category" associated with the "categories" table. Define the necessary properties and relationships.

Task 3:

Write a migration file to add a foreign key constraint to the "posts" table. The foreign key should reference the "categories" table on the "category_id" column.

Task 4:

Create a relationship between the "Post" and "Category" models. A post belongs to a category, and a category can have multiple posts.

Task 5:

Write a query using Eloquent ORM to retrieve all posts along with their associated categories. Make sure to eager load the categories to optimize the query.

Task 6:

Implement a method in the "Post" model to get the total number of posts belonging to a specific category. The method should accept the category ID as a parameter and return the count.

Task 7:

Create a new route in the web.php file to handle the following URL pattern: "/posts/{id}/delete". Implement the corresponding controller method to delete a post by its ID. Soft delete should be used.

Task 8:

Implement a method in the "Post" model to get all posts that have been soft deleted. The method should return a collection of soft deleted posts.

Task 9:

Write a Blade template to display all posts and their associated categories. Use a loop to iterate over the posts and display their details.

Task 10:

Create a new route in the web.php file to handle the following URL pattern: "/categories/{id}/posts". Implement the corresponding controller method to retrieve all posts belonging to a specific category. The category ID should be passed as a parameter to the method.

Task 11:

Implement a method in the "Category" model to get the latest post associated with the category. The method should return the post object.

Task 12:

Write a Blade template to display the latest post for each category. Use a loop to iterate over the categories and display the post details.
